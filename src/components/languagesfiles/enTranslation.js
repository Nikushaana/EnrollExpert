    "I am Zaza Gonashvili, the founder of ENROLL EXPERT, probably already known to that segment of Sudanese society that has already studied, is currently studying, or whose children have studied or will study in Georgia. What could be better than having your name and surname associated with studying in Georgia? In 2016, I co-founded the company with my Sudanese friend Khalid Mustafa Ateya Mahmoudia. Our company's initial purpose was to make Georgia more popular among Sudanese people all over the world in terms of education. This was accomplished admirably, as evidenced by the fact that over 1,000 Sudanese students study in Georgia each year. In 2020, the company's aim has shifted to becoming more worldwide, effectively attracting international students from the Persian Gulf and Africa. More than 1700 international students have been enrolled at various universities in Georgia as of today, thanks to the assistance of an ENROLL EXPERT team. The company's major purpose is to assist international students in overcoming bureaucratic difficulties that are unfamiliar to them in many circumstances. As a parent, I understand how difficult it is for a parent to send their child to a distant country, far away from them, for a better education and future, relying on people they don't know. As a parent, I have accepted personal responsibility for their well-being while residing in Georgia. As a result, ENROLL EXPERT is now the only online platform in Georgia that communicates with students 24 hours a day, seven days a week, from the time they register on the site until they complete their studies. ENROLL EXPERT is what you're looking for.  You can rely on the advice and witness the outcomes. ENROLL EXPRET's team is made up of highly qualified employees, including agents, lawyers, real estate agents, and 12 partners from Sudan, Egypt, India, Oman, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Canada, the United States of America, Bahrain, Kuwait, and Nigeria.",
